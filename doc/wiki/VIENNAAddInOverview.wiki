#summary About the VIENNA-AddIn

The VIENNA Add-In (Visualizing Inter ENterprise Network Architectures) is an extension to the UML modeling tool [http://www.sparxsystems.com.au Enterprise Architect] for modeling B2B collaborations.

Using the two technologies a business process modeler can unambiguously define inter-organizational business processes and business documents on a technology independent level. The platform independent models may be used to derive platform specific artifacts for service oriented architectures e.g. BPEL, WSDL, XSD.
