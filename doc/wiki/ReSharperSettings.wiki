We (at IOS) are using the [http://www.jetbrains.com/resharper/index.html JetBrains ReSharper] Add-In for Visual Studio. Here are the settings we use for the vienna-add-in project.

= To-do Items =

We use !ReSharper's To-do Items feature to annotate implementations of the UN/CEFACT's Naming and Design Rules in the code.

== Patterns ==

*NDR-Rule*: The following pattern is used to match rule identifiers:

{{{
(\W|^)(?<TAG>\[R ....\])(\W|$)(.*)
}}}

Usage example:

{{{
/// [R 1234]: This is the implementation of rule 1234.
}}}

*Deviations*: The following pattern is used to annotate deviations from NDR rules:

{{{
(\W|^)(?<TAG>DEVIATION)(\W|$)(.*)
}}}

Usage example:

{{{
/// [R 1234]
/// This is the implementation of rule 1234.
/// Deviation: We have implemented a simplified version of rule 1234.
}}}

== Setup ==

  # Open the !ReSharper Options panel (`ReSharper > Options`).
  # Select `To-do Items` section.
  # Create the two patterns described above.
  # Create or modify a filter to include the new patterns.

== Usage ==

  # Open the !ReSharper To-do Explorer (`ReSharper > Windows > To-do Explorer`).
  # Select a filter including the NDR patterns.
