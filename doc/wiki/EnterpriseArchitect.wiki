#summary What is Enterprise Architect

Enterprise Architect is a UML modeling tool developed by [http://www.sparxsystems.com Sparx Systems]. The VIENNA Add-In extends Enterprise Architect to support inter-orgainzational business process modeling and business document modeling.

The used technologies are UN/CEFACT's Modeling Methodology (UMM) and UN/CEFACT's Core Components Technical Specification (CCTS). 


*Source/Target vs. Supplier/Client

For beginners the concept of source and target of a connector may be confusing in Enterprise Architect. Enterprise Architect uses the terms supplier and client in order to define the source and the target of a connector. The following figure shows how EA denotes the two ends of a connector. Please note, that an aggregation/composition is always drawn from the aggregated element (on the right hand side) to the aggregating element (on the left hand side)!
