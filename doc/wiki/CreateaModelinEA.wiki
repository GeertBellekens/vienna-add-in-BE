The VIENNA Add-In is an extension to the UML modeling tool Enterprise Architect (1). This page explains how to create models using Enterprise Architect, and how to access the VIENNA Add-In functionality through the Enterprise Architect User Interface.

  # From the main menu, select _File / New Project..._ and choose the directory and filename for storing the project:

  # In the _New Project_ dialog, select a directory and filename to store the EA project file
  # In the _Select model(s)_ dialog, choose _`<`default`>`_ from the _Technology_ list and select none of the check boxes in the second list:

  # After clicking _OK_, the new project is generated. It contains exactly one empty model, as you can observe in the _Project Browser_ view:

  # You can now access the VIENNA Add-In functionality through the _Add-Ins / VIENNAAddIn_ menu:

  # The most frequently used functions, depending on the current context, can also be accessed through the _Add-In_ context menu - simply right-click the newly created model in  the _Project Browser_ and select the _Add-In / VIENNAAddIn_ menu:
    http://vienna-add-in.googlecode.com/svn/wiki/images/CreateaModelinEA_05.gif
  # To start modeling business documents using the newly created model, you must set the model as a UMM or UPCC Model by selecting _Add-Ins / VIENNAAddIn / Set Model as UMM2/UPCC3 Model_ from the main menu:
