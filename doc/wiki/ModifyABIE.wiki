#summary Modify an existing ABIE
=Aggregate Business Information Entities=

Every Aggregate Business Information Entity (ABIE) is based on an Aggregated Core Component (ACC). When creating a new ABIE, this ABIE is derivated from an ACC by specifying which attributes and associations of the ACC should be inherited by the ABIE. The VIENNA Add-In provides the _ABIE Editor_ dialog for creating new ABIEs based on specific ACCs or modifying existing ones.

=Modify ABIEs=

  # Prepare a UPCC3 model in Enterprise Architect
  # In the _Project Browser_, select a BIELibrary and right-click on a contained ABIE

  # The section _Associations_ shows all existing ABIEs that are associated with the current ABIE. You can change the selection of the ABIEs you want to associate from the first column, and for each of those ABIE you can select the Association Business Information Entities (ASBIEs) that should be used from the second column:

  # Finally, click the _Update ABIE_ button
  # After the ABIE was updated successfully, a confirmation message is shown:
