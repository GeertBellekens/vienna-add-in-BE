The following changes have been made to the original ebInterface
MapForce files in order to get them through the importer:

ebInterface2CCTS_1_1.mfd:
=========================

- Add constant component with value "Root:Invoice".

- Expand:

  - "Biller"
  - "InvoiceRecipient"
  - "OrderingParty"
  - "Details"
  - "ReductionDetails"
  - "Tax"
  - "PaymentConditions"

ebInterface2CCTS_2_1.mfd:
=========================

- Map "Biller/FurtherIndentification/IdentificationType" to
  SUP "Language".

- Remove ASCC mapping for "Biller/Address".

- Expand "Biller/Address".

ebInterface2CCTS_3_1.mfd:
=========================

- Split single input component into two components with roots
  "InvoiceRecipient" and "OrderingParty".

- For both new components:

  - Remove ASCC mapping for "Address".

  - Expand "OrderReference" and "Address".

ebInterface2CCTS_4_1.mfd:
=========================

- Remove ASCC mappings for:

  - "Details/ItemList"
  - "Details/ItemList/ListLineItem"
  - "Details/ItemList/ListLineItem/Delivery"

- Map "Details/ItemList/ListLineItem/Quantity/Unit" to SUP
  "MeasureUnit" of CDT "Measure".

- Map "Details/ItemList/ListLineItem/TaxRate/TaxCode" to SUP
  "FormatString" of CDT "Rate".

- Expand:

  - "Details/ItemList/ListLineItem/AdditionalInformation"
  - "Details/ItemList/ListLineItem/Delivery"

ebInterface2CCTS_5_1.mfd:
=========================

- Map "AdditionalInformation/Classification/ClassificationSchema" to
  SUP "Classification/ClassName/Language".

ebInterface2CCTS_6_1.mfd:
=========================

- Remove mapping for "ReductionDetails/TaxRate/TaxCode" (TaxRate is
  mapped elsewhere).

ebInterface2CCTS_7_1.mfd:
=========================

- Remove XOR function:

  - Map "Tax/VAT/TaxExemption" to "Tax/ExemptionReason".
  - No explicit mapping for "Tax/VAT/Item".

- Remove mapping for "Tax/VAT/Item/TaxRate/TaxCode" (TaxRate is
  mapped elsewhere).

- Map "Tax/OtherTax/Comment" and "Tax/OtherTax/Amount" to
  "Tax/AdditionalInformation/Content".

ebInterface2CCTS_8_1.mfd:
=========================

- "UniversalBankTransaction" cannot be mapped, because it cannot be
  linked to the main source elemen tree (due to the use of xsi:type).

- Remove mapping for "PaymentConditions".

General notes:
==============

1) Elements must be expanded in order to be included in the MapForce
   mapping file. This is important for:

   a) Attaching sub-trees to the main source tree.

   b) Deriving mappings for complex elements in cases where the
      element's complex type is mapped elsewhere.

2) If a complex type is mapped to a CDT, the content of elements of
   this type is implicitly mapped to the CON of the CDT.

   If a complex type is mapped to an ACC or MA, the content cannot be
   mapped.
