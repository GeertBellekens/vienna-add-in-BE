1. About UMM2 Add-In

This software is an add-in for the UML modeling tool 'Enterprise
Architect' from Sparx Systems, which allows a comfortable and standard compliant

version is the current candidate for v1.0. 
UMM2AddIn is currently developed in a research project of the University of Vienna
and the Resarch Studios Austria.

evaluation purpose only. Further versions of UMM2AddIn will be released 
in infrequent intervals - major version increments will contain new features,

enhancements.
All new releases will be announced on the UMM2AddIn mailinglist (see section 7).

5. Features

As already depicted in section 1, this version is a preliminary release for 
testing and evaluation purpose. Thus this version covers only a subset of the 
final release features of UMM2AddIn


    Features:
    
    *) UML Profile: The UMM2 is defined as UML-Profile according to the UMM2 meta model
    (UMM2 Meta Model - Foundation Module, Candidate for 1.0). This means that all 
    stereotypes (along with their tagged values) are available as model elements in the
    UML toolbox of Enterprise Architect.
    *) UMM2 Business Transaction Patterns: UMM2 uses transactions to model information 
    exchange. In order to support the modeling process different approaches to model
    a business transaction are available. Business transactions may be either generated
    using worksheet input or created from scratch using the six predefined patterns.
    *) Validator: The validator ensures the compliance of a model to the UMM2 meta model. 
    The modeler is provided with two different validation approaches namely the top
    down validation (full model check) and the bottom up (part model check) validation.    
    *) Worksheet Editor: built-in worksheet editor to support the requirements
    and information gathering process. Worksheets are defined for every step in the 
    UMM2 process. The worksheet input used during the modeling process can be
	exported in several formats (e.g. Microsoft Word, HTML) for documentation
	purpose. Hence the complete business information is kept in one place. 
    *) BPSS Transformation: supports the transformation of UMM2 binary collaborations  
    to BPSS v1.10 compliant instances.
    *) BPEL Transformation
    *) Guard Condition Editor: sets either BPSS v1.10 compliant condition
    expressions or OCL compliant objectstate expressions as guard conditions. 
    To use objectstate expressions the behavior of a BusinessEntity must be 
    prior described through a BusinessEntityLifecycle
    *) Model Structure Creation: creation of an initial UMM2 compliant model
    structure and context sensitive adding of "subviews" to BRV and BTV.
    A BDV classification structure can be automatically created according to UN/CEFACTs 
    Common Business Catalogue.
    *) Pattern creation: The six business transaction patterns can be created 
    automatically using a transaction generation wizard.
    *) Association Wizard: menu-based setting of mapsTo associations between
    BusinessCollaborationProtocols and BusinessCollaborationUseCases and 
    BusinessTransactions and BusinessTransactionUseCases.
    *) BCSS Plugin
